	<h2>ABOUT CENTRAL PROVINCE</h2>
	<div class="about-content">
		The Central Province  is one of the nine provinces of Sri Lanka, the first level administrative division of the country. (The provinces have existed since the 19th century but did not have any legal status until 1987 when the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka established provincial councils.The Central Province is primarily in the central mountainous terrain of Sri Lanka. It is the 6th largest province by area and is home to 2.5 million people. It is bordered by North Central Province to the north, Uva Province to the east, North Western Province to the west and Sabaragamuwa Province to the south and west. The province's capital is Kandy......

	<a href="image/central.png" data-lightbox="mygallery" data-title= "<p>The Central Province is located in the central hills of Sri Lanka comprising of three administrative districts: Kandy, Matale and Nuwara-Eliya. The land area of the province is 5,575 km2 which is 8.6% of the total land area of Sri Lanka. The province lies on 6.6°- 7.7° northern latitudes and between 80.5°-80.9° eastern longitudes. The elevation in the province ranges from 600 ft to over 6000 ft above the sea level. The province is bordered on the north by the North-Central Province, on the east by the River Mahaweli, on the south by Uma Oya and the mountain range of Adam’s Peak, Kirigalpotta and Thotapala and on the west by the mountain ranges Dolosbage and Galagedera.

Kandy is the second largest city in Sri Lanka and the main city of the Central Province as well as the Kandy District and this ancient city lies at an elevation of 465 metres (1,526 ft) above the sea level. Kandy is the last capital of the ancient kingdom in Sri Lanka. It is one of the most sacred cities in Sri Lanka because of the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic and also is one of the most beautiful cities in the island. The city is surrounded by verdant mountains and the lake and the adjacent Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic add more beauty to the city.

        <h3><a href="">HOTEL</a></h3>
        
        <p>Sri Lanka’s ancient kingdoms date back over 2,500 years, giving its wildlife, waterfalls, ruins and reams of tea plantations an aura of enlightenment. As an island nation, the country benefits from a wonderful feeling of remoteness, making it easy to lose yourself amidst the tropical rainforests, immaculate white-sand beaches and age-old towns. The southern Hill Country is home to Ella, with its rumbling Ravana Falls and the 1,300-metre-high cliff or Ella’s Rock - reachable via a scenic two-hour trek along a tea-house-laden railway track.</p>

        <h3><a href="">RESTURENT</a></h3>
        <p>There are some common elements, to be sure. But the "rice and curry" spreads that make up most Sri Lankan meals are pretty different from the northern saag paneer or Goan vindaloo at your local lunch buffet. Sri Lankan food offers a vivid array of flavor combinations: sweet caramelized onion relishes, bitter melon, spicy scraped coconut, and the burn of curry tamed by mild rice, and palm sugar sweetened desserts. Samosas and dhal (lentil curry) look familiar, but upon closer inspection, these, too, have a definitively Sri Lankan spin</p>
        <a href="image/hotel/res.jpg" data-lightbox="mygallery" data-title="Sri Lankan cuisine is known for its particular combinations of herbs, spices, fish, vegetables, rices, and fruits. The cuisine is highly centered around many varieties of rice, as well as coconut which is an ubiquitous plant throughout the country. Seafood also plays a significant role in the cuisine, be it fresh fish or preserved fish. As a country that was a hub in the historic oceanic silk road, contact with foreign traders brought new food items and cultural influences in addition to the local traditions of the country's ethnic groups, all of which have helped shape Sri Lankan cuisine. Influences from Indian (particularly South Indian), Indonesian and Dutch cuisines are most evident with Sri Lankan cuisine sharing close ties to other neighbouring South and Southeast Asian cuisines.<br><br>
Sri Lanka was historically famous for its cinnamon. The true cinnamon tree, or Cinnamomum verum used to be botanically named Cinnamomum zeylanicum to reflect its Sri Lankan origins. This is a widely utilized spice in Sri Lanka, and has a more delicate, sweet taste in comparison to Cinnamomum cassia which is more common in some other South Asian cuisines. Contrasting the local cuisine with those of neighbouring regions, Sri Lankan cuisine is characterized by unique spice blends with heavy use of Sri Lankan cinnamon and black pepper, as well as by the use of ingredients such as maldive fish, goraka (garcinia cambogia), pandan leaf, lemongrass, and jaggery made from the kithul palm syrup. Sri Lanka is also a consumer of many varieties of red rice, some of which are considered heirloom rices in the country. Tea is also an important beverage throughout the country, and Sri Lanka is known for producing some of the world's finest tea." class="buy-btn" href="">Read More</a>

        <a href="image/hotel/cafe.jpg" data-lightbox="mygallery" data-title="The first arabica coffee plants introduced to Ceylon may have arrived from Yemen via India, by Muslim pilgrims in the early 17th century. However, the Sinhalese were unaware of the use of berries in preparing a beverage They only used the young leaves for curries and the flowers as offerings at their temples.<br><br>

The first attempt at systematic cultivation of coffee was undertaken by the Dutch in 1740. It was initiated by Governor Baron van Imhoff and his successors; van Gollenesse and Loten. However, it was confined to the low-country and was relatively unsuccessful with low levels of production. Production was also restricted by the Dutch East India Company as they did not want competition against coffee produced on their plantations in Java. By 1762, annual coffee production was only 100,000 pounds.
The British, who first arrived on the island in 1796 and took control in 1815, continued experiments with coffee production. These early ventures, mainly in the coastal areas around Galle,failed due to the unsuitability of the area for coffee cultivation. The first to successfully grow coffee on a commercial scale was George Bird, who established a coffee plantation in Singhapitiya. Edward Barnes, who became Governor of Ceylon in 1824, established another plantation in Gannoruwa in 1825 (now a part of the Royal Botanical Gardens, Peradeniya). These were followed by a number of other government officials establishing plantations in the region. The only native to grow coffee on a commercial scale was Jeronis de Soysa and about a quarter of the total production was from the smallholdings of native farmers. Most of these early ventures were economically unsuccessful, due to a number of factors including unsuitability of the lowland areas, competition from the West Indies, lack of cultivation skills and poor infrastructure. The first plantation in the mountainous Kandyan area, was established in 1827 which, a few years later, spread to many other areas in the country, becoming profitable.

<br>Cultivation of Coffea arabica
<br> Cultivation of Coffea robusta
<br><br>At the initiative of the British colonial administration, Sri Lanka experimented with coffee as a plantation crop in the 1830s. Sri Lankan coffee cultivation and export prospered when the West Indies ended slavery, which affected its extensive coffee production. Further expansion occurred when the British government in Sri Lanka sold government lands they had obtained from the kings of Kandyan. Tamil labour from South India was recruited by the 1830s. During the period 1830–1850, coffee production assisted in the country's development and a capitalist society emerged. The Bank of Ceylon supported the proliferation of coffee estates, which resulted in infrastructure development within the Kandyan region. During the period of worldwide economic depression in 1846, production declined, conflicts arose, and taxes were levied to compensate the losses to the economy, due to the falling price of coffee. Labour conscription was introduced in 1848, causing a rebellion, which was later quelled.[20] However, the plantation era transformed Sri Lanka; nearly one third of the plantation area was owned by the local people. With high demand and prices for coffee in the European market, coffee planting increased. Investors flocked to Ceylon from overseas and around 100,000 ha (386 sq mi) of rain forest was cleared to make way for coffee plantations. The term Coffee rush was coined to describe this developing situation in 1840. By 1860, Sri Lanka, Brazil and Indonesia, were the three largest coffee-producing countries in the world." class="buy-btn" href="">Read More</a>

        <h3><a href="">SUPER MARKET</a></h3>
        <p>Shopping for groceries comes with several things – getting stuck in the traffic, walking up and down the aisle, and standing in line for the checkout, among other things most of us would rather not face. It’s good when you have the time and you like to do it all, but what if you are feeling unwell and living on your own and the fridge is empty, or some other “disaster”?We are very fortunate to live in an age where almost anything is available at the click of a button. If you think shopping is a chore and you’d rather not do it,</p>
        <a href="image/hotel/supermarket.jpg" data-lightbox="mygallery" data-title="Arpico Super Centre also popularly simply known as Arpico is a chain of supermarkets which is also regarded as a departmental store located in Sri Lanka owned by Richard Pieris & Company. The retail shopping mall was initially started with the concept of supermarket and then transformed its business operations as a supercentre. It is one of the three largest retail operators on the island, alongside Cargills Food City and Keells Super. Arpico Super Centre is also regarded as one of the two most popular departmental stores in Sri Lanka along with ODEL. The Richard Pieris & Company, pioneered the concept of hypermarkets in Sri Lanka through their Arpico Super Centre chain.

The controlling interest in the company is held by Ceylon Theatres PLC.In 1844 British businessman William Milne started ‘Milne & Company',[3] general warehousemen, importers of oilman stores etc,[4] with branches in Kandy and Galle. In 1850 Milne was joined by his friend, David Sime Cargill,[5] and the firm became ‘Milne, Cargill & Co'.[6] In 1860 Milne retired from business in Ceylon and moved back to Scotland to form a company in Glasgow to look after the business of Cargill & Co. in the UK. Cargill became the sole partner until he was joined by David MacKenzie and the name was changed to ‘Cargill & Co’. The company had a Colombo office at the intersection of Price and York Streets in Colombo Fort, a Kandy office at Upper Lake Road and an office in Galle Fort at 22 Pedlar Street. The Galle office was closed down in 1863. In 1890 the business expanded with the purchase of 'Medical Hall,’ a chemist and druggist company. Cargills also established another company, ‘Sime & Co.’,[6] which sold lower quality goods. In 1896 Cargill & Co. was converted into a Limited Liability Company registered in Glasgow.Two years later, the company bought James McLaren &Co.’s business in Nuwara Eliya, establishing a branch there.<br><br>Lanka Sathosa also known as Sathosa is a wholesale and retail chain located in Sri Lanka.

        <h2><a href="gallery.html">KANDY</a></h2>
        <p>Kandy is a major city in Sri Lanka located in the Central Province. It was the last capital of the ancient kings' era of Sri Lanka.</p>
        <a href="image/kandy/1h.jpg" data-lightbox="mygallery" data-title="<p>KINDOM OF KANDY</P> Sena Sammatha Wickramabahu (1473–1511) was the first king of the Kingdom of Kandy, he was a royal from the Kotte Royal Blood line and ruled Kandy as a semi-independent kingdom under the Kingdom of Kotte, making it the new capital of the Kandyan Kingdom. Sena Sammatha Wickramabahu was followed by his son Jayaweera Astana (1511–1551) and then by Karaliyadde Bandara (1551–1581) who was succeeded by his daughter Dona Catherina of Kandy (1581–1581). Dona Catherina was succeeded by Rajasinha I. Rajasinha I however, preferred to rule the hill country from the Kingdom of Sitawaka on the west of the island. A period of turmoil for power ended with the ascent to the throne by Konappu Bandara who came to be known as Vimaladharmasuriya I. Having embraced Buddhism, he consolidated his authority further by bringing the tooth relic of the Lord Buddha to Kandy from a place called Delgamuwa<br>
The last ruling dynasty of Kandy were the Nayaks. Kandy stayed independent until the early 19th century. In the Second Kandyan War, the British launched an invasion that met no resistance and reached the city on February 10, 1815. On March 2, 1815, a treaty known as the Kandyan Convention was signed between the British and the Radalas (Kandyan aristocrats). With this treaty, Kandy recognized George III as its King and became a British protectorate. The last king of the kingdom Sri Vikrama Rajasinha was captured and taken as a royal prisoner by the British to Vellore Fort in southern India along with all claimants to the throne. Some of the family members were also exiled to Tanjore (now known as Thanjavur, in Tamil Nadu). Their erstwhile living place is still referred to as "Kandy Raja Aranmanai" on the eastern part of Thanjavur town on Old Mariamman Koil Road. class="buy-btn" href="">Read More</a>

        <h2><a href="">NUWARA ELIYA</a></h2>
        <p>Nuwara Eliya is a city in the hill country of the Central Province, Sri Lanka. Its name means "city on the plain (table land)" or "city of light".</p>
        <a href="image/nuwaraeliya/ho1.jpg" data-lightbox="mygallery" data-title="Nuwara Eliya (Sinhala: නුවර එළිය [nuwərə ɛlijə]; Tamil: நுவரெலியா) is a city in the hill country of the Central Province, Sri Lanka. Its name means city on the plain (table land) or city of light. The city is the administrative capital of Nuwara Eliya District, with a picturesque landscape and temperate climate. It is at an altitude of 1,868 m (6,128 ft) and is considered to be the most important location for tea production in Sri Lanka. The city is overlooked by Pidurutalagala, the tallest mountain in Sri Lanka. Nuwara Eliya is known for its temperate, cool climate – the coolest area in Sri Lanka.<br><br>The city was founded by Samuel Baker, the explorer of Lake Albert and the upper Nile in 1846. Nuwara Eliya's climate lent itself to becoming the prime sanctuary of the British civil servants and planters in Ceylon. Nuwara Eliya, called Little England, was a hill country retreat where the British colonialists could immerse in their pastimes such as fox hunting, deer hunting, elephant hunting, polo, golf and cricket.<br><br>
Many of the buildings retain features from the colonial period such as the Queen's Cottage, General's House, Grand Hotel, Hill Club, St Andrew's Hotel and Town Post Office. New hotels are often built and furnished in the colonial style. Visitors to the city can wallow in its nostalgia of bygone days by visiting the landmark buildings. Many private homes maintain their old English-style lawns and gardens." class="buy-btn" href="">Read More</a>
